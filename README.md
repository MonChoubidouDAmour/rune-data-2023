# rune-data-2023
Tracking the S13 League of Legends keystones

This only tracks the NA data, but could easily be used for any other region by changing the `BASE_URL/NEW_URL` links. 

# Request
The python3 script that fetches data using the RIOT API, the speed is very limited because RIOT forcefully limits the requests.

# Notebook
The exploited data collected by the Python script. This is an (amateur) python notebook that simply conveys surface-level observations, like the fact that `Unsealed Spellbook` is an embarrassment of a Rune and that `Predator` is in a bad spot. 

One could make the case `Omnistone` didn't deserve its treatment.
